# RoboFriends

RoboFriends is a basic react app.
Here I have used react components along with states. I've also used a rest api to fetch the users list.
We can simply search for each robot/user using the search-box.
You need to know basic javascript and react to understand this project. 
I have used a package named 'tachyons' which makes it easier and deals with the css part making the code efficient and smaller.
